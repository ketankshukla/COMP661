### Mutable vs Immutable Collections

- **Mutable Collections**: These are objects that can be modified after creation. Examples include `list`, `dict`, and `set`. You can add, remove, or change elements within these collections without creating a new object.

- **Immutable Collections**: These are objects that cannot be changed once created. Examples include `tuple`, `frozenset`, and strings (`str`). Any modification results in the creation of a new object.

### Python's Handling of Mutable and Immutable Objects

- **Mutable Objects**:
    - Stored in memory as a reference to the object.
    - Modifications are made **in place**, meaning changes affect the same memory address.
    - Example: If you pass a list to a function and modify it, the changes persist outside the function because both the function and the caller reference the same list.

- **Immutable Objects**:
    - Any operation that appears to modify the object creates a new object instead.
    - Example: If you pass a string to a function and attempt to modify it, the original string remains unchanged because the modification results in a new string.

### Application to Python Dictionaries

- Python **dictionaries** are mutable:
    - You can add, remove, or change key-value pairs.
    - This means dictionaries can grow and adapt over their lifetime.
    - However, **keys** in a dictionary must be immutable (e.g., `str`, `int`, `tuple` of immutable elements). This is because keys rely on hash values for quick lookup, and mutable keys would make the hash inconsistent.

#### Example:
```python
# Mutable example
my_dict = {"a": 1}
my_dict["b"] = 2  # Adding a new key-value pair
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Attempt to use mutable object as a key
my_dict[[1, 2]] = 3  # TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

### Real-World Application

Imagine a **user session management system**:

- **Immutable Objects**:
    - You use a `frozenset` to represent permissions assigned to a user. This ensures permissions cannot be accidentally modified during runtime, maintaining security and consistency.

- **Mutable Objects**:
    - The system maintains a dictionary where the key is the user ID, and the value is a mutable list of active sessions. This allows you to dynamically add or remove sessions as users log in or out.

#### Example:
```python
# Permissions (immutable)
permissions = frozenset(["read", "write"])

# User sessions (mutable)
user_sessions = {}
user_sessions["user1"] = ["session1"]
user_sessions["user1"].append("session2")
print(user_sessions)  # Output: {'user1': ['session1', 'session2']}
```

By using immutability for critical data like permissions and mutability for flexible components like session lists, you strike a balance between safety and adaptability.
