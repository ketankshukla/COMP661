The datetime module in Python is great for handling dates, times, and intervals. It’s got several key classes, each for different uses:

1. date: Represents a calendar date (year, month, day). Use it when you need just the date—like tracking birthdays. Example: date(2024, 11, 6) represents November 6th, 2024.

2. time: Represents a time of day (hour, minute, second, etc.). Use it when time matters but not the date—like setting alarms. Example: time(14, 30) means 2:30 PM.

3. datetime: Combines both date and time. Use it when you need the full timestamp—like for scheduling events. Example: datetime(2024, 11, 6, 14, 30) means Nov 6th, 2024, at 2:30 PM.

4. timedelta: Represents the difference between two dates or times. Use it for calculating durations or adjusting dates. Example: timedelta(days=5) lets you add or subtract 5 days from a date.

5. timezone and tzinfo: Used for handling time zones. This is handy when you’re dealing with different time zones. Example: timezone(timedelta(hours=-5)) represents a UTC-5 time zone.

These classes help you manage dates and times easily in Python, making it simple to handle events, schedules, or do calculations with dates.
