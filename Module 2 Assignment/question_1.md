## Understanding Python List Sorting with `reverse=True`

This simple Python code demonstrates the built-in sorting functionality for lists.

```python
numbers = [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)
```

## Code Breakdown

**Initial List Creation**
The code begins by creating a list called `numbers` containing six integers: 2, 4, 3, 0, 1, and 5.

**Sorting Operation**
The `sort()` method is called on the list with the parameter `reverse=True`. This performs two key actions:
- Sorts the list in ascending order
- Reverses the sorted result due to the `reverse=True` parameter

**Output**
When executed, the code will print:
```python
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

## Key Points

- The `sort()` method modifies the original list directly (in-place sorting)
- Using `reverse=True` creates a descending order sort
- This operation is permanent until the list is modified again
- The time complexity of this operation is O(n log n)

If you need to preserve the original list, you could use the `sorted()` function instead:
```python
numbers = [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
```
