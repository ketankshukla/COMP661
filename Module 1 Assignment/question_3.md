## Documentation Guide for Algorithm Performance Measurement Python Code

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Python code designed to measure and compare the execution time of an algorithm across different problem sizes.

### Overview

The program implements a simple algorithm and measures its execution time for increasing problem sizes. It runs multiple iterations to ensure accuracy and provides a tabular output of the results.

### Functions

#### `algorithm(problem_size)`

**Description:**  
Simulates a computational algorithm with a given problem size. This function performs a loop that increments and decrements a variable, simulating some form of computational work.

**Parameters:**
- `problem_size` (int): The size of the problem, determining the number of loop iterations.

**Note:** This function is a placeholder and can be replaced with any algorithm whose performance needs to be measured.

---

#### `time_algorithm(problem_size)`

**Description:**  
Measures the execution time of the `algorithm` function for a given problem size.

**Parameters:**
- `problem_size` (int): The size of the problem to be passed to the `algorithm` function.

**Returns:**  
A float representing the execution time in seconds.

---

#### `main()`

**Description:**  
The main function that orchestrates the performance measurement process. It:
1. Prints a header for the results table.
2. Initializes the problem size and runs four iterations, tripling the size each time.
3. For each problem size, runs the algorithm multiple times and calculates the average execution time.
4. Displays the results in a tabular format.
5. Allows the user to run the program again or exit.

### Usage

To run this program:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `algorithm_performance.py`).
3. Execute the script using Python from your command line or terminal:
   ```bash
   python algorithm_performance.py
   ```
4. Observe the results and choose to run again or exit when prompted.

### Example Output

```
Problem Size    	Seconds   
---------------	----------
1,000,000      	0.0234
3,000,000      	0.0701
9,000,000      	0.2103
27,000,000     	0.6309

Press 'x' to exit or any other key to run again: 
```

### Key Features

1. **Multiple Runs:** The program runs the algorithm multiple times for each problem size to obtain a more accurate average execution time.

2. **Scalable Problem Sizes:** Starting with an initial size of 1,000,000, the problem size is tripled in each iteration, allowing for observation of performance across a wide range of inputs.

3. **Precision Timing:** Utilizes `time.perf_counter()` for high-precision timing measurements.

4. **User Interaction:** Allows the user to run multiple sets of measurements or exit the program.

5. **Formatted Output:** Presents results in a clear, tabular format with proper alignment and comma-separated large numbers for readability.

### Conclusion

This program serves as a useful tool for measuring and comparing the performance of algorithms across different problem sizes. It can be easily modified to test various algorithms by replacing the contents of the `algorithm` function, making it versatile for different performance analysis scenarios.
