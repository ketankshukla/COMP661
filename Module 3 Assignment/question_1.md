The code calculates and displays the average temperature for each day in the `temperatures` dictionary. 
Here's what each part does:

1. **Dictionary Initialization**:
   ```python
   temperatures = {
       'Monday': [67, 71, 74, 77],
       'Tuesday': [52, 56, 66, 50],
       'Wednesday': [77, 80, 87, 95],
       'Thursday': [67, 77, 81, 77],
       'Friday': [54, 60, 67, 60],
   }
   ```
    - A dictionary named `temperatures` is created.
    - Each key is a day of the week.
    - Each value is a list of four temperature readings (in Fahrenheit) for that day.

2. **For Loop and Printing**:
   ```python
   for k, v in temperatures.items():
       print(f'{k}: {sum(v)/len(v):.0f}')
   ```
    - **`for k, v in temperatures.items():`**
        - Iterates over each key-value pair in the `temperatures` dictionary.
        - `k` is the key (the day of the week).
        - `v` is the value (the list of temperatures for that day).
    - **`sum(v)/len(v)`**
        - Calculates the average temperature for the day by summing the list of temperatures (`sum(v)`) and dividing by the number of readings (`len(v)`).
    - **`print(f'{k}: {sum(v)/len(v):.0f}')`**
        - Prints the day and its average temperature.
        - `{sum(v)/len(v):.0f}` formats the average temperature to zero decimal places (rounds to the nearest whole number).

**Summary of What the Code Does**:

- **Calculates the average temperature for each day** by summing the temperature readings and dividing by the number of readings.
- **Prints out each day along with its average temperature**, formatted as a whole number.

**Example Output**:
```
Monday: 72
Tuesday: 56
Wednesday: 85
Thursday: 76
Friday: 60
